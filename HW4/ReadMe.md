##**Simple Revenue Recognition Principle**
* **Revenue** is said to be **earned when product is exchanged**,
    but not when cash is exchanged.
* If cash is paid in advance and product is exchanged later, then it is **Deferred Revenue**.
* If cash is paid later and product is exchanged first, then it is **Accrued Revenue**.
